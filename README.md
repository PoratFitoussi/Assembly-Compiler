# Assembly-Compiler
Assembler for a lighted version of Assembly
The assembler receives as input a file containing a program in assembly language, and its role is to convert the source code into code machine, and build an output file containing the machine code.

Detecting errors in the source program:
The assembler performs a careful parsing of the source program in assembly language, and is able to detect and report a variety of errors, such as: an operation-name that is not defined, an incorrect number of operands, an operand type that is not suitable for the operation, a register number that does not exist, use of a symbol that is not defined, a symbol that is defined more than once, a numerical value of abnormal size, and other errors.
